$$a_0 = f(0) = \sum_{j=0}^{\infty} y_j \prod_{m=0}^{\infty} \frac{x_m - x_j}{x_m - x_j}$$


\[ a_0 = f(0) = \sum_{j=0}^{k-1} y_j \prod_{\substack{m=0 \\ m \neq j}}^{k-1} \frac{x_m}{x_m - x_j} \]

$$a_0 = f(0) = \sum_{j=0}^{\infty} y_j \prod_{m=0}^{\infty} \frac{x_m - x_j}{x_m - x_0}$$

$$a_0 = \sum_{j=0}^{k-1} \prod_{m=0, m \neq j}^{k-1} \frac{x_m}{x_m - x_j}$$

$$a_0 = \sum_{j=0}^{k-1} \prod_{m=0, m \neq j}^{k-1} \frac{x_m}{x_m - x_j}$$



Using $\LaTeX$ will enhance both, the look of your papers and your productivity.
